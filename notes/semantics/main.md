# Concrete C: CCert Language Shift Semantics
In this site, I am documenting the semantics of each language
that is present in the CompCert C Compiler. Specifcally, we document
the semantics of the Shift operator. The goal is to learn the semantics
of each intermediary language so that we can easily define *how* the
semantics need to be changed for Concrete C.

Below are the individual pages for each language:
* [Compcert C/CLight](./clight.md)
* [C Sharp Minor](./csharpminor.md)
